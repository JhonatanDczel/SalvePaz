## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://github.com/JhonatanDczel/img/blob/main/salve-paz-gif.gif)


It was born as a collaborative project among classmates of the Fundamentals of Programming course, as a token of gratitude for the teachings provided by the instructor who taught the course.

At the beginning of the semester, he proudly showed us the work that some of his previous students had done with the Galapagos library, and we didn't want to fall behind!
